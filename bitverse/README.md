## About
The bitverse is an open source project within the Cloudberry project currently running at [LTU](http://www.ltu.se). The purpose of the project is to develop a secure and highly scalable P2P messaging and storage framework based on the [Chord DHT algorithm](http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/chord:sigcomm01/chord_sigcomm.pdf).

A bitverse network consists of two different types of nodes, so called **edge nodes** and **super nodes**. Edge nodes are typically connected to a super node, which makes sure messages are delivered even if an edge-node is located behind a firewall. Instead of addressing servers or devices using IP addresses, each node is globally addressable in the bitverse network using a hash key (e.g. *7d7dbf33abf34bdb7ef47231a7507372e2c908d6*). Each node (independent of other nodes) is responsible for calculating their own hash keys (a.k.a node ids). The node id is currently a SHA-1 hash key of a self-generated UUID string.

Edge nodes typicially send messages to the super node. Messages send to other nodes connected to the same super node will be delivered directly by the super node. However, if an edge node is connected to a foreign super node somewhere, the super node will use the DHT to lookup the address (IP address) of the foreign super node and deliver the message to that super node. This means that the distance to any other node in the bitverse network is maximum 3 hops away independent of the size of the bitverse network.

Instead of using port numbers as in TCP or UDP to identify connections, the bitverse uses a service identifier, which can be an arbitrary string. To be able to send and receive messages, developer has to register and create a **service** object (which is very similar to a Unix socket) on their edge node objects. A service object only resides in the edge nodes where it is created. When a service object is created, developer has to provide an AES encryption key. Only edge nodes having access to that encryption key can send and receive messages to that particular service. That is, the super nodes are only responsible for forwarding messages towards their destination and are not able to decrypt the content enclosed in the messages.     

Currently, the only supported language is Go, but a JavaScript library will soon be released. 

## Installation
Just type `go get ltu-cloudberry/mdc/bitverse` to install the bitverse Go project. You can also find a bitverse binary file in the [bin](https://github.com/ltu-cloudberry/mdc/tree/master/bitverse/bin) directory if you just want to run a standalone super node. 

To setup a supernode, call `bitverse --local localhost:1111`, where the `--local` flag the specifies host and port where the super node should bind to. You may also pass the `--debug` flag if you want to enable debugging (more print traces).

## Example Golang
To be able to create an edge node, a *BitverseObserver* compliant object must first be implemented. The edge node object will call functions in the bitverse observer object when it becomes connected to a super node, or when other nodes (siblings) joins or leaves the super node (it is possible to retreive a list of edge nodes on any other foreign super node in the bitverse network).   

```go
type MyBitverseObserver struct {
}

func (myBitverseObserver *MyBitverseObserver) OnSiblingJoined(node *bitverse.EdgeNode, nodeId string) {
	fmt.Println("sibling " + nodeId + " joined")
}

func (myBitverseObserver *MyBitverseObserver) OnSiblingLeft(node *bitverse.EdgeNode, nodeId string) {
	fmt.Println("sibling " + nodeId + " left")
}

func (myBitverseObserver *MyBitverseObserver) OnSiblingHeartbeat(node *bitverse.EdgeNode, nodeId string) {
	fmt.Println("sibling " + nodeId + " heartbeat")
}

func (myBitverseObserver *MyBitverseObserver) OnChildrenReply(node *bitverse.EdgeNode, nodeId string, children []string) {
	fmt.Println("received children list from " + nodeId)
}

func (myBitverseObserver *MyBitverseObserver) OnConnected(node *bitverse.EdgeNode, remoteNode *bitverse.RemoteNode) {
	fmt.Println("now connected to super node " + remoteNode.Id())
}
```

To setup an edge node, we need to create a WebSocket transport and pass a reference to our bitverse observer.

```go
var done chan int

node, done := bitverse.MakeEdgeNode(bitverse.MakeWSTransport(), new(BitverseObserver))
fmt.Println("-> my id is " + node.Id())

go node.Connect("localhost:1111")

<-done
```

### Messaging

To create a messaging service (a storage service will be supported in the future) we need to create a MsgServiceObserver. The OnDeliver function in the MsgServiceObserver object will be called when messages are received by our service object.

```go
func (msgServiceObserver *MsgServiceObserver) OnDeliver(msgService *bitverse.MsgService, msg *bitverse.Msg) {
...	
}
```

To create a service we need to call the *node.CreateMsgService(...)* function and pass along a service id (does not have to be globally unique) and an AES encryption key. It is up to developer to securely pass and store the encryption key. It needs to be a 32 bit hex formated string, and can either be generated by calling `bitverse --generate-aes-secret` or by calling *bitverse.GenerateAesSecret()*.

```go
var serviceId = "my service"
var secret = "817130b45245941f4f8fd0ad77ccb5bf115faecf83d1956f9f01c666b9f35f6e"

msgServiceObserver := new(MsgServiceObserver)
node.CreateMsgService(secret, serviceId, msgServiceObserver)
```

Messages can easily be send using the *msgService.Send(...)* function on the messaging service object. It is also possible to get a reference to an already registered messaging service object by calling *node.GetMsgService(...)*. 

```go
var serviceId = "my service"
msgService := edgeNode.GetMsgService(serviceId)
msgService.Send("6a133a1b41f987210559ceb4ed9b1dbf58aec876", "hello")

```

If we except a reply back from the other node, we can call the *msgService.SendAndGetReply(...)* and provide a closure which will be called when the reply is received. We also need to provide a timeout in seconds in case the other node failed to reply, or that node simply does not exists.

```go
msgService.SendAndGetReply("6a133a1b41f987210559ceb4ed9b1dbf58aec876", "hello", 10, func(err error, reply interface{}) {
		if err == nil {
			fmt.Println("got a reply " + reply.(string))
		} else {
			// will likely timeout unless node 6a133a1b41f987210559ceb4ed9b1dbf58aec876 is online
			fmt.Println("failed to send message to node with id 6a133a1b41f987210559ceb4ed9b1dbf58aec876")
		}
	})
```

The remote messaging service object receiving that message can then reply to that particular message by calling *msg.Reply(...)*.

```go
if msg.Payload == "hello" {
	msg.Reply("hi!")
}
```

For a full example, see https://raw.github.com/ltu-cloudberry/mdc/master/bitverse/examples/messaging.go. Setup a super node at localhost:1111 (`bitverse --local localhost:1111`) and call `go run messaging.go`. 

### Bitverse Repositories

A DHT based framework like bitverse cannot not only be used for routing and resolving connection information to foreign super nodes, but also as a general purpose key-value store for storing any kind of information. In this case, every super node becomes a database engine. A big advantage of creating a distributed key-value store engine based on a DHT is that all key-values are distributed and replicated between the super nodes, which is makes it very scalable and robust. 

Similar to addressing node id with hash keys, a key-value repository is also identifed by global unique string (a hashkey). However, creating bitverse repositories is a bit different compared to other database engines. Anyone can claim ownership of repository by calling function *node.ClaimOwnership(...)* and provide the id to the repository and a public RSA encryption key. If no one owns that particular repository, it is assigned and can from now on only be access by the one that has access to the corresponding private RSA encryption key. Every operation done on the repo are signed using the private key. In this way, the super node can verify that only the owner of the repo can manipulate it. Additionally, the edge nodes use AES to encrypt all stored values (keys are not encrypted). This means that it is impossible for the super nodes to access and interpret stored data, well as least the values.

PEM encoded private and public RSA keys can be generated by calling `bitverse --generate-rsa-keys mycert`. In this case, two files will be created "mycert" (private key) and "mycert.pub" (public key). RSA keys can also be created by calling *bitverse.GeneratePem(...)*

The following code snippet shows how to claim ownership of a repo.

```go
var repoId = "my repo"
var secret = "817130b45245941f4f8fd0ad77ccb5bf115faecf83d1956f9f01c666b9f35f6e"

prv, pub, _ := bitverse.ImportPem("cert") // assumes two files called cert and cert.pub stored in current working directory

node.ClaimOwnership(repoId, secret, prv, pub, 10, func(err error, repo interface{}) {
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Println("failed to claim repo: " + err.Error())
		} else {
			fmt.Println("sucessfully claimed repo")
			myRepo := repo.(*bitverse.RepoService)
		}
	})
```

Storing key-value pair can be done by calling the *myRepo.Store(...)*.

```go
repo.Store("myKey", "myValue", 5, func(err error, oldValue interface{}) {
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("failed to store key in bitverse network: " + err.Error())
	} else {
		switch oldValue.(type) {
			case string:
				fmt.Println("replacing key-value pair in the bitverse network, old value was " + oldValue.(string))
			case nil:
				fmt.Println("storing new key-value pair in the bitverse network")
		}
	}
})
```

Similarly, getting a value can be done by calling *myRepo.Lookup(...)*

```go
testRepo.Lookup("myKey", 5, func(err error, value interface{}) {
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("failed to get value from the bitverse network: " + err.Error())
	} else {
		switch value.(type) {
			case string:
				fmt.Println("the value is " + value.(string))
			case nil:
				fmt.Println("unknown key")
		}
	}
})
```

For a full example, see https://raw.github.com/ltu-cloudberry/mdc/master/bitverse/examples/repo.go. Setup a super node at localhost:1111 (`bitverse --local localhost:1111`) 
and call `go run repo.go`.
